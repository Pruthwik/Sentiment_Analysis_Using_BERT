he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present .	1
preceding the very original " a soldier's story " and the recently released " the hurricane , " " in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters .	1
the film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted .	1
tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him .	1
as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist .	1
poitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character .	1
never nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing .	1
however , unlike " the hurricane " where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance .	1
as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role .	1
he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople .	1
he would refer to tibbs as " boy " and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him .	1
as the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff .	1
he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors .	1
what i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film .	1
he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil .	1
instead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future .	1
most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes .	1
this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day .	1
jewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate .	1
 " in the heat of the night " shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's .	1
it displays this perfectly .	1
however , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest .	1
it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim .	1
there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) .	1
also , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered .	1
the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic .	1
 ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson .	1
he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , " in the heat of the night " and the even better " in cold blood . " )	1
in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance .	1
ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's .	1
in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world .	1
you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open .	1
in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful .	1
he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes .	1
grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map .	1
when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms .	1
grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy .	1
their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for .	1
leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions .	1
he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges .	1
he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated .	1
he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) .	1
whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white .	1
leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth .	1
tobey maguire fits well in the role .	1
with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude .	1
but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility .	1
katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants .	1
this is a plot line i had trouble with .	1
douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions .	1
unfortunately " romeo must die " bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms .	0
the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking .	0
enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) .	0
kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family .	0
a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down .	0
it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends .	0
the following morning po sing is found dead .	0
suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder .	0
his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture .	0
issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter .	0
the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder .	0
he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined .	0
hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work .	0
escaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death .	0
 " romeo must die " is in many ways a fun film .	0
it is both absurd and assured .	0
the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes " the godfather " .	0
the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's " china girl " , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another .	0
their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history .	0
the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable .	0
li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination .	0
allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace .	0
it's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic .	0
but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it .	0
delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film .	0
an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance .	0
the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac's son , colin .	0
the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in .	0
an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written .	0
first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film .	0
having a career as one of the industry's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and " romeo must die " does look good .	0
but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes .	0
the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in .	0
the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing .	0
and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah's bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever .	0
the best things about the film are its fight scenes .	0
jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles .	0
one needs only to see his film " fist of legend " to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat .	0
here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that " lethal weapon 4 " ( jet's u . s . debut ) didn't allow .	0
unfortunately , a lot of jet's fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision .	0
also " romeo must die " must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent .	0
obviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba's " streetfighter " , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film .	0
it's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted .	0
one problem though about the fight scenes .	0
those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon .	0
they do have an internal rhythm to them .	0
a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography .	0
the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance .	0
this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing .	0
here in " romeo must die " , there is no staccato .	0
