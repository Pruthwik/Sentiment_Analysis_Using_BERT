of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature .	1
the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic .	1

soon , zoologist gregg o'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill's mother .	0
this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where " formula " isn't just business , it's a way of life .	0

i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer , but what you see there , are essentially the snippets from the two major ( and cool ) swashbuckling sequences from the film .	0

the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual " intelligently ditzy " romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy .	1

the effort involved in " lumumba " is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all .	1
he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .	1
holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .	1
in the end , i can't call it a bad effort .	1
at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts .	1

of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side .	1

 " in dreams " might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths .	0

it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions .	0
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .	0
sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship .	1
alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare .	1
from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard .	1
his entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have .	0
lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it .	0
john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original .	1
but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .	1
sure , billy crystal did it before in rabbit test , but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie .	1
so , obviously , his appearance in " phantom menace " is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful .	1
his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message .	0
it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star .	1

these two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it's now * twice * as boring as it might have been .	0
i'm talking about films like " 8mm " and its director , joel schumacher .	0
i also found it odd that bobby and carol's other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention .	1
the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen .	1
there's genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity .	0
by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters .	1

there's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder .	0
the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .	1
stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in " permanent midnight " ; it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills .	1
but , even in the film's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite .	0
for example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window .	0

djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .	1
it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy .	1
we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny .	1

by the time they reach the hospital , it's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe .	0
the finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) .	0

kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut " sometimes less is more " .	0

so we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror .	0
unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene .	0
his entry and adaptation to the whole " rock 'n roll " lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch .	1

 " blair witch . . "	1
the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why .	1
watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is .	1
his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination .	1
we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best .	1
gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles .	1
but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle .	1
one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom .	1
 ? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny , but he's also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions .	1
the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash .	1
see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend .	1
again , the storyline is as cliched as they come .	1
however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people .	1
not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics .	1
as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the " blair witch hunt " .	1
while i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood .	0
luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above .	1
in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film .	1
 " 8mm " doesn't condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it .	0
even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker .	1
iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger .	1
scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny .	1
the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence .	1
witherspoon is a revelation .	1
synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother , a fledgling restauranteur .	0
the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship .	1
and just when you think it's finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further .	0
the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching .	0
carpenter might like to think he's made a western here but it's a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts .	0
she plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children's book illustrator who's plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children .	0
the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone .	0
sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) .	0
the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men .	1
clown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn .	0
but if true , why ?	0
how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ?	1
the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent " serious " movie getting .	0
for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending .	1
capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace .	0
it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance )	0
smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan " catholicism wow ! " ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished .	1
even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others .	0
this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds .	1
let's see , where should i start ?	0
the rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen .	1
shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film .	1
i would never call myself a " star wars " fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america .	1
the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this .	1
carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat .	0
i haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet .	0

discovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy .	0
williams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all .	1
from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( " being john malkovich " and " fargo " ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with " the blair witch project " .	1
the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful .	0
like " stand by me " , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting .	1
because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential .	1
based on the 1959 television show of the same title , " the untouchables " may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script .	1

that's parillaud's character talking . . .	0
which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts .	0
jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy .	1

stargate ========	1

walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon .	1
it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) .	1
sometimes the stories are compelling .	1
maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed " empire " will direct .	1
for example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth .	0
walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious .	1
my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program .	0
for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way .	1
and hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production .	0
it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material .	1
but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom .	1

 " permanent midnight " shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author's words-- " escape the drug scene " ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings .	1

however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost .	1
although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick .	0
the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a .	1
and it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents .	0

hey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere .	0
while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed .	1
scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town .	1
the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever .	0
denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that's made the kennedy family so popular .	0

bobby's world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) .	1

lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government .	1

he hasn't slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane .	1
same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy .	1
the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be .	1

after the release of " the blair witch project " , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch .	1

stalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched .	0
no , it definitely is not .	0

what makes " 102 dalmatians " such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic " heroes " of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? .	0
